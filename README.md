Hi, I'm André, originally from Algarve, Portugal. ☝️☀️😎 I'm a postdoctoral researcher who's been working on wet-and-dry Microbiology since 2013, now focusing on Bioinformatics. Currently learning **python** and have worked with **R** and **bash** since 2014. Into trail running 🏃‍♂️ and bouldering 🧗‍♂️.

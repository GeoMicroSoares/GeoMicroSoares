I'm originally from Algarve, Portugal. ☝️☀️😎 I'm a staff scientist at Prof. Alexander Probst's Environmental Metagenomics group (check it out [here](https://www.uni-due.de/probst-lab/home_en.php). I've worked on wet-and-dry Microbiology since 2013, have experience in Illumina- and Nanopore-based metagenomics, analysis of multivariate ecological (and others) data using R, bash and python. Into trail running 🏃‍♂️ and bouldering 🧗‍♂️.

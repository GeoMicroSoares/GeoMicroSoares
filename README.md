Hallo there - I'm André, originally from Algarve, Portugal. ☝️☀️😎 

Currently, I'm a staff scientist at Prof. Alexander Probst's Environmental Metagenomics group at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany (check it out [here](https://www.uni-due.de/probst-lab/team.php). I've worked on wet-and-dry Microbiology since 2013, have experience in Illumina- and Nanopore-based metagenomics, analysis of multivariate ecological (and others) data using R, bash and python. Into trail running 🏃‍♂️ and bouldering 🧗‍♂️.
